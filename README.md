Now for the fun part.

This code is released into the public domain. Feel free to use / change as you see fit this code or parts of it.

This program is written by a hobbyist to learn / play with neural networks in Python. This is my first Python project.

The algorithm implemented in this project is from section 4.7 in Tom Mitchell's Machine Learning text book. It uses SIGMOID activation function.

I tested the algorithm with two cases (For some reason Python is very slow so I could not test a higher number of iterations.)
1. 100 hidden nodes - the best accuracy after 20 descents was 87%
2. 300 hidden nodes - after 65 training descents accuracy on the testing data set was 84%.

I hope you find this useful.
